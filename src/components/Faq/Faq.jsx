            props and State is the core concept of react. it has some feature. i
            have discus about it bellow Props Props is read only.it can't change
            from user component Props is unidirectional. it can pass from parent
            to chields.but cant pass from chields to parent Props is quite
            smeller like HTML attribute. But not same if props is change from
            parent component the chields component is render again State State
            can change on declared component or can change from it's child
            components State is changed dynamically
